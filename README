PageRank for ANN papers before 2013

This is a c++ version of PageRank to rank the ANN papers by the
order of Papers, Authors and Venues. It involes use of sqlite3 to
hold the database. This is an assignment of Web Data Mining 
Course, 2016 Fall, PKU. 

----------------------------------------

Content of this package

- README
  This file, which describe some important infomation of this package
- bin
  Three excusion files to rank papers, authors and venues
  -- rank_author
  -- rank_paper
  -- rank_venue
- datasrc
  Input files for the main file
  -- acl.txt: paper citation network, using paper ids
  -- author_citation_network.txt: using author ids
  -- in64.txt: a small size version of acl.txt, which is used to debug
  -- ina46.txt: a small size version of author_citation_network.txt, which is used to debug
- db
  Paper database folder, which contains files related to the database
  -- author_ids.txt: a map of authors' names and their ids
  -- paper_ids.txt: a map of papers' titles and their ids
  -- paper2venue.txt: generated by a python file, a map of papers' venues and their ids
  -- paperDB.db: a sqlite3 database, which contains three tables: 
      -- TITLE(ID KEY NOT NULL, TITLE TEXT NOT NULL, YEAR INT)
      -- AUTHOR(AUTHOR_ID KEY NOT NULL, NAME TEXT NOT NULL)
      -- VENUE(ID KEY NOT NULL, VENUE TEXT NOT NULL)
      These tables are all imported by those txts above in this folder.
  -- praseOutVenue: a folder contains the python file to generate paper2venue.txt and its source file
      -- acl-metadata.txt: src file, describe metadata of all the papers
      -- prase.py: prase the metadata. NOTE that it should be excute via python2, otherwise there will be some coding errors
 - debug
   A folder contains some files remain while debuging
 - res
   Contains result files
   -- author_rank.txt
   -- paper_rank.txt
   -- venue_rank.txt
 - src
   Includes the main source file
   -- pagerank++.cpp: the main src file, and it needs some slight change for macros for different use

 How to use this package

1 There are some macros in the file and each of them refer to a spectical purpose
        #define PAPER
        #define AUTHOR
        #define VENUE
        #define DEBUG
  Make those useless Macros a comment so that you can disable some code.
2 Compile the main src file, and link it with sqlite3 library, like
        src$ g++ -o ../bin/rank_paper pagerank++.cpp -Wall -l sqlite3 
3 Run it with corresponding inputfile.
  acl.txt is the input to rank papers and venues, 
  while author_citation_network.txt is the input to rank authors
  Sample:
        src$ ./rank_paper < ../datasrc/acl.txt > ../res/paper_rank.txt
